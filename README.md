 *******School Management System ******
 
Earlier this year, I enrolled in a new school to start my academic journey. First, I created a student account by providing my personal details and selecting my preferred classes. After registration, I was assigned to different subjects including Math, Science, and History.
Each subject has a name, code, assigned teacher, classroom location, and scheduled time. Some subjects are compulsory, while others are optional.
I could view my timetable online and received notifications before each class. The system also allowed me to download study materials uploaded by teachers.
After completing each lesson, we had assignments and quizzes. I submitted my work online, and the teacher graded them. I was able to see my grades and feedback.
Later, I had to take a midterm exam. The exam schedule was visible in the system, and I could see the exam room and date. After exams, I received my results and overall score report.
Finally, I gave feedback on one of the teachers and rated the subject to help the school improve its teaching quality.
